            <ul>
                <li>DSC 10 - Principles of Data Science</li>
                <p>An introductory course that develops computational thinking and tools 
                    necessary to answer questions that arise from large-scale datasets. 
                Emphasizes an end-to-end approach to data science, introducing programming 
                techniques in Python that cover data processing, modeling, and analysis.
                </p>
                <li>DSC 20 - Programming and Basic Data Structures for Data Science</li>
                <p>Provides an understanding of the structures that underlie the programs, 
                    algorithms, and languages used in data science by expanding the repertoire 
                    of computational concepts introduced in DSC 10 and exposing students to techniques 
                    of abstraction. Covers topics including recursion, higher-order functions, 
                    function composition, object-oriented programming, interpreters, classes, and 
                    simple data structures such as arrays, lists, and linked lists.
                </p>
                <li>DSC 30 - Data Structure and Algorithms for Data Science</li>
                <p>Builds on topics covered in DSC 20 and provides practical experience in composing 
                    larger computational systems through several significant programming projects using Java. 
                    Students will study advanced programming techniques including encapsulation, abstract data types, 
                    interfaces, algorithms and complexity, and data structures such as stacks, queues, priority queues, 
                    heaps, linked lists, binary trees, binary search trees, and hash tables.
                </p>
                <li>DSC 80 - Practice and Application of Data Science</li>
                <p>The marriage of data, computation, and inferential thinking, or “data science,” is redefining how 
                    people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand the world. Students master the 
                    data science life-cycle and learn many of the fundamental principles and techniques of data 
                    science spanning algorithms, statistics, machine learning, visualization, and data systems.
                </p>
                <li>DSC 40A - Theoretical Foundations of Data Science I</li>
                <p>Students will become familiar with mathematical language for expressing data analysis problems and 
                    solution strategies, and will receive training in probabilistic reasoning, mathematical modeling of 
                    data, and algorithmic problem solving. Introduces fundamental topics in machine learning, statistics, 
                    and linear algebra with applications to data analysis.
                </p>
                <li>DSC 40B - Theoretical Foundations of Data Science II</li>

                    language for expressing data analysis problems and solution strategies, probabilistic reasoning, 
                    mathematical modeling of data, and algorithmic problem solving. Covers fundamental topics in combinatorics, 
                    graph theory, probability, and continuous and discrete algorithms with applications to data analysis.

                <li>DSC 100 - Introduction to Data Management</li>
                <p>An introduction to storage and management of large-scale data using classical relational (SQL) systems, with 
                    an eye toward applications in data science. The course covers topics including the SQL data model and query language, 
                    relational data modeling and schema design, elements of cost-based query optimizations, 
                    relational data base architecture, and database-backed applications.

                <li>DSC 106 - Introduction to Data Visualization</li>
                <p>Introduces the principles, techniques, and algorithms for creating effective visualizations. The course draws on 
                    the knowledge from several disciplines including computer graphics, human-computer interaction, cognitive psychology, 
                    design, and statistical graphics and synthesizes relevant ideas. Students will design visualization systems using D3 
                    or other web-based software and evaluate their effectiveness.
