                        "Have you ever listened to K-Pop?" 
                        Over the past decade, K-Pop, otherwise known as Korean Pop music, has garnered mass 
                        attention in the US where groups like BTS and Blackpink 
                        have become names that are recognizable by the general public. 
                        From its eccentric fashion and addictive sound to its sharp choreography, 
                        thereâ€™s no wonder as to how K-Pop has managed to attract attention among the masses.

                    <p> Considering K-Pop's seemingly massive growth over time, 
                        how much has K-Pop's popularity in the US grown?
                        What about K-Pop has made it appealing to US audiences? 
                        To answer these questions, we analyzed various datasets from 
                        Spotify, Billboard, and concerts from the last decade to see 
                        how K-Pop's popularity has developed within the US over the years.

                    <h3>K-Pop's Popularity in the US</h3>
                    <p>
                        First, let's take a look at K-Pop albums' performance on American record
                        charts as well as the growth of K-Pop concerts in 
                        the US over the past decade. For this, we used Billboard chart data, 
                        which is an American music record chart. In the US, Billboard is commonly used to 
                        convey the popularity of artists' performance
                        through its ranking of the most popular albums and EPs in the US. 
                    </p>
                    <div id="boxPlot"></div>
                    <p>
                        In the early years of the decade, K-Pop albums tended to rank in the lower
                        end of Billboard's Top Current Albums chart. Once 2015 hit, we can see a 
                        shift in their overall performance as many albums managed to
                        breakthrough past the #100 position. With increasing
                        interest and more consumers streaming/buying K-Pop albums, it 
                        demonstates this recent trend of K-Pop albums achieving higher peak positions. 
                    </p>
                    <div id="concertTours"></div>
                    <p>
                        As you can see, there is an upward trend in the number of tours held by 
                        K-Pop artists over the past decade. Prior to 2015 and 2016, the total number of US tours barely hit 
                        over 10. Then from 2017 onwards, we can see that they now hold around 15 or more, 
                        suggesting an increase in demand of K-Pop artists to perform in the US.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The middle of the decade marks this shift in K-Pop's overall performance in
                        the US, from barely being able to hit #100 peak position to now hitting #1's 
                        and having over a dozen artists holding tours around the US. 
                        This means more people are listening and showing interest in the genre now more than ever, 
                        as listening to a K-Pop album or going to a concert
                        is much more common than it was before.

                    <h3>The Diversity of K-Pop</h3>
                    <p>
                        What makes K-Pop so appealing? Let's look at the audio features
                        of various genres' tracks to get an idea of what might attract US audiences to K-Pop. 
                        Here we used Spotify, one of the US's most popular music streaming platforms,
                        to gather our data.
                    </p>
                    <div id="radarChart"></div>
                    <p>
                        According to Spotify, audio features can be defined by the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Danceability:</b> how suitable a track is for dancing; measured based on tempo, rhythm, beat</li>
                        <li><b>Energy:</b> represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity; typically feel fast, loud, and noisy</li>
                        <li><b>Liveness:</b> presence of audience in recording; whether a track is performed live or not</li>
                        <li><b>Valence:</b> describes musical positiveness conveyed by track</li>
                        <li><b>Acousticness:</b> whether track is acoustic, played solely by instruments</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Comparing the audio features of K-Pop tracks against other highly listened-to genres in 
                        the US, we see that high danceability and energy are common. Meanwhile,
                        valence is falls on the moderate end with acousticness and liveness on the lower end. 
                        This suggests that K-Pop is appealing to US audiences due to its close musical
                        similarities with other popular music genres. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The exponential rise of K-Pop albums on American record charts like the above
                        demonstrates K-Pop's immense growth in popularity within the US
                        over the past decade. Back in 2010, K-Pop barely had any 
                        presence in the US, but now are able to 
                        compete alongside American artists in the music industry and beyond.

                        The datasets were curated from audio features data found utilizing the Spotify API and

                        data was gathered from all tracks listed on Spotify's
                        category playlists, in which each category represents a genre.
